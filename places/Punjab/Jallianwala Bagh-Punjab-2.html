		<div style="font-size: 1.5em;">Located near the famous Golden Temple of Amritsar, Jallianwala Bagh is a public garden that also houses a memorial to commemorate the massacre of peaceful celebrators by the British forces. Spread over 6.5 acres of land, Jallianwala Bagh is associated with one of the saddest days in Indian History when thousands of innocent people were killed on the orders of General Dyer as they gathered for a peaceful celebration of Baisakhi. The place has now been turned into a beautiful park and is managed by the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust.

            There is a memorial tablet at the entrance which serves as a record of history. The tragic incident left a deep scar on the country, and a memorial was constructed post the independence for the innocents who lost their lives in this devastating incident. Established by the government of India in 1951, the massacre memorial was inaugurated by Dr Rajendra Prasad on 13th April 1961. 
            
            A number of structures are present inside the premises which resound of the atrocities that occurred here. These include a wall which still bears the marks of the bullets that were hurled blindly at the civilians and a well in which many people jumped to save themselves from the onslaught of the bullets. It is estimated that over a 1000 Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs lost their lives in this brutal assault. a narrow alley of immense historical importance passes through here. An air of eerie calm still lingers over the Jallianwala Bagh and gives one a feeling of indescribable sadness and peace.
