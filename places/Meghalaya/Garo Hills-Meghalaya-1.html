		<div style="font-size: 1.5em;">Situated close to the Indo-Bangladesh Border, the Garo hills are part of the Patkai hill range, which extends across the Indo-Myanmar border. The hills get their name from the Garo tribe who inhabit the area. The Garo Hills, spanning across 8000 sq metres of area, offer magnificent viewpoints, densely populated with subtropical forests and rare endemic species of animals and birds. For ease of administration, the area has been divided into five districts: the East Garo Hills, West Garo Hills, North Garo Hills, South Garo Hills, and the South West Garo Hills. The Nokrek peak is the highest peak of this hill range, but the Arabella hills and the Tura peak also offer some breathtaking scenery. The Nokrek Biosphere reserve, one of the most important national parks with international importance, is located in this nature-rich area. The hills are also decked with splendid waterfalls, enriching the environmental coherence of the place.

            The Garo tribe are a culturally rich ethnic group, attaching tradition and significance to many parts of their natural surrounding. In doing so, they protect and respect their habitat, thereby preserving the immaculate allure of their surroundings. The tree of Boldak Matchu Karam, the rock of Naka Chikong, and the lake of Napak are all examples of these traditions, and the maintenance of the same attracts hordes of tourists all year round. Between the months of September and December, the post-harvest festival of 100 Drums Wangala is celebrated with great pomp at the Asnang village, now becoming a multicultural attraction with neighbouring tribes participating in the festivities with great enthusiasm as well. The largest town in the hills is Tura, which is also the most developed area and home to all the important administrative buildings.<br><br>
