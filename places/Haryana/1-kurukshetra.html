		<div style="font-size: 1.5em;">A city in the state of Haryana, Kurukshetra, also known as Dharmakshetra is known as the "Land of the Bhagavad Gita". Situated 170 km north to Delhi, the place is famous for the battle between the Kauvaras and the Pandavas in the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. It is the place where Lord Krishna is said to have recited the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. <br><br>

		In the past, Kurukshetra was one of the most important centres for Vedic civilization as well as education. Lord Buddha and several Sikh Gurus are known to have visited and spent time in Kurukshetra. The place has a large number of devout centres, holy shrines and kunds which trace back to the epic ages and the earliest Indian civilisation. Archaeological evidence claim that this city was in existence during the pre-Harrapan times. Kurukshetra was also called Thanesar or Sthaneswar, meaning 'place of God'. The Archaeological evidence lists that Ashoka, the Mauryan ruler made Kurukshetra a centre of learning for people from all over the world. The place is famous for its temples, lakes and museums documenting the history of pre-Harappan and Harappan civilisations. A few kilometres from Kurukshetra is the village known as Amin, where there are remnants of a fort which is believed to be Arjun's son, Abhimanyu's fort.<br><br><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Reach Kurukshetra Easily , With the help of Google Maps</b></p> <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d55301.65167465433!2d76.84688217026252!3d29.969277018737053!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x390e46cf85c85d3d%3A0x7f06e815caca33f4!2sKurukshetra%2C%20Haryana!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1634242058000!5m2!1sen!2sin" width="400" height="300" style="border:2px solid gray;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
